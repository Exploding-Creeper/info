# Joining Exploding Creeper

Firstly, unlike other modding groups/teams, your mods/code still fully belongs to you, unless you choose otherwise. Joining our group will give you access to a couple of cool things, while you get to meet some awesome people.

## Requirements to join

* You need to have atleast 1 published mod with more than 1k downloads
* Your mod/project needs to open-source (once a member, you are allowed to do closed-source projects, but your initial one must always remain open-source)
* You need to be a member of our discord server
* You need to know how github works and you need to be able to work as a team

## Benefits of being in our group

* You get access to a Jenkins server where you can do dev builds for your mods/projects
* You get access to a Maven server where you can host API's for usage by other projects
* You get access to basic web hosting for your project
* You can upload videos to our youtube channel
* You get a special role on our discord server
* You get access to the Claptrap Discord bot that you can use in your own server to track curseforge releases
* You get access to coders that can help you work on your projects
* In the future, you will have access to a shared minecraft server that you can use for testing your mods
